# SUI-Portfolio

The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio website. So that I can display my skillset to potential clients or hiring managers.

This project gave me a headdache in many different ways, but the worst one was the overflow space when i would switch to a mobile sized display.
I was able to fix this issue by adding (overflow-x: hidden) and that seemed to due the trick.

Some big things to take away from this project are
* 1: timeblocking is super helpful and can help with consistency
* 2: Not asking for help doesnt make you cool. Its just makes things harder to understand.

Somethings I learned during this are how to use flex boxes, how to use a reset.css, and how to use media queries.
